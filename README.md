## Postscript

1. This application does not have complex activation algorithm and it is truly fantastic. __So please pay for it if possible.__

2. The file generated, `Custom.mxtpro`, is actually a zip file and contains a text file, `Pro.key`, where there is a key string. 

3. `MobaXterm.exe` has another mode. You can see it by adding a parameter `"-customizer"`.

   ```
   $ .\MobaXterm.exe -customizer
   ```

   I don't know how to make custom settings take effect in `Customizer` mode directly. 
   
   The only way I found is that you should export custom settings to a file named `MobaXterm customization.custom` which is also a zip file. Then merge two zip file: `Custom.mxtpro` and `MobaXterm customization.custom` to `Custom.mxtpro`. Finally copy newly-generated `Custom.mxtpro` to MobaXterm's installation path.
